It's that time of year again...  The time when young gophers dream of high-quality articles about Go programming.  We've run our "Advent" series at GopherAcademy for two years now, and it has been by far the most successful content we've ever published.  Each post receives thousands of page views from all across the globe.

This year we're changing things slightly: We've renamed it to the "December Blog Series" to recognize the multi-cultural and international readership that our blog has gained.  And you're in for a treat!  We have great articles lined up from a wide variety of authors -- and content aimed at both beginner and advanced Gophers.

Last year we had 25 articles from some of the best authors in the Go community, and a few who had yet to become big.  Derek Parker's `Delve` was announced in the Advent series, and now it's featured as part of Microsoft's new cross platform editor.  You never know what kind of surprises you'll find on the GopherAcademy blog, but we are sure there are some big ones coming this year.

Here's a [link](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/series/advent-2014/) to last year's posts.  And [2013](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/series/advent-2013/) has some great articles too.

We can't wait to share these posts with the community, and we're glad you're here.  There are still a few slots open, so if you're itching to share something with the Go community [pick a day and sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H0rj7TJo0t8GWyNdGwEc6bGcDj6UgJUN42JtAtbPMrk/edit#gid=0&vpid=A2)  If English isn't your primary language, we have a team of editors on standby to help you write your best article ever.

For Docker's 2nd birthday they've been planning something that we think is pretty amazing.

Starting March 23rd, the Docker & Go communities will be hosting dozens of open-source-a-thon parties around the world. At these parties the Docker and Go community members will be contributing and mentoring others on how to contribute to open-source. There will also be an online component to permit everyone to be able to participate regardless of location.

We encourage everyone to participate, whether you're a seasoned open-source contributor, or have never contributed. In doing so you'll be supporting your favorite open-source projects, as well as helping marine wild-life.

If you've never contributed to open-source before this is a particularly great time to jump in, as there will be plenty of mentors to help get you started.

Contributions to the project at these events and in the weeks following will count toward Dockerâ€™s donation to the Oceanic Society and its mission to conserve the habitat of Moby Dock and blue whales across the planet.

Contributors can:

* Learn how to contribute to open source
* Learn Go
* Contribute regardless of their technical experience

Contributors will:

* Help marine wildlife (a donation will be made for every contributor)  
* Have a great time
* Enjoy cake, food and drinks
* Make a difference in the world

Mentors will:

* Help people with how to contribute to open source
* Help with git
* Mentor with code contributions
* Help marine wildlife (a donation will be made for every mentor)  

If you are interested in mentoring then please RSVP on the meetup page (see http://docker.party/events for links) and sign up to be a mentor at http://goo.gl/forms/TAFVpnh3K8

The full details of the events including cities and dates are available at http://docker.party/events 

Thanks and we hope to see you there!

At last, the UK community has decided to organise a Go conference for the
UK and rest of the world! Save the date: Friday 21st August 2015.

Even though it's the first Golang UK conference there is an experienced team
behind it: we have previously organised other tech conferences (one with ~700
attendees last year) and numerous meetups of the [Go London User
Group](http://www.meetup.com/Go-London-User-Group/).

We are currently looking for people to give talks so [please submit a
paper](http://www.golanguk.com/speakers/) if you want to meet the great UK
community. We will be closing the CFP on the 31st May. We are interested in
receiving all kinds of submissions. Golang UK uses an anonymised selection
process which you can [read about here](http://www.golanguk.com/speakers/). We
also have a [code of conduct](http://www.golanguk.com/conduct/) to make sure
that everyone feels welcome.

Right now our blind bird tickets are available. These are sold below cost price
and are the cheapest you will be able to [buy a
ticket](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/golang-uk-conference-2015-tickets-16233380478).
So, if you don't have one yet, now is the time!

As a community-run conference we invest surplus funds into making the future
years' conferences even better. It also means that we rely on our volunteers,
sponsors and partners to make the conference a success. If you are interested
in helping in any capacity please [get in touch](mailto://info@golanguk.com).

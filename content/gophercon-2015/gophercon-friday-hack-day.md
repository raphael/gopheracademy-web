With less than a month til GopherCon 2015 we’ve been hard at work on plans for the Friday 10th Hack Day. The previous year’s unofficial Friday Hack Day was so popular we decided this year to integrate it into the conference proper. 

We're providing the space and the wifi, you bring your favorite project and work together with friends you only get to see in person once a year at GopherCon.

After the brisk start of the two previous days, Friday will arrive at a more leisurely pace with most activities starting at 10 am.

Kicking off in the Mile High Ballroom theatre we will feature a presentation “Investment 101 for Startups” by Robin Vasan, managing director at Mayfield, one of the most prestigious investment firms in the country. Robin will be joined for a question and answer session by the CEO's from two of Mayfield's investments. Paul Dix from InfluxDB and Mitchell Hashimoto from HashiCorp who will share their experiences as founders going through the investment process.

After Robin’s presentation we’re turning the theatre over to you. This is your chance to step on the main stage and tell the world something about Go.

This year we have three lightning talk categories, Hack and Tell, Call to Action, and Go Tips and Tricks. Registrations for lightning talks will close on the 20th of June so head over to the [registration page and sign up](https://gophercon.typeform.com/to/c6GOUe).

We will post the list of lightning talks on the GopherCon website by the end of June.

Next up is the general area directly adjacent to the theatre, which will be open all day. This is your space to work on anything Go related that takes your fancy. Don’t forget to tweet your creations and tag them with [#gophercon](https://twitter.com/hashtag/gophercon?src=hash).

Finally, we’re very pleased to announce details of something we’ve been working on for a while now. In addition to the theatre and the general spaces, we have negotiated with the conference center for a series of smaller rooms suitable for workshops and focused activities.

And because Friday is for you, we’ve turned the rooms over to you, the GopherCon Gophers.

In no particular order, we have:

### Denver Gopher's room

Denver is a great city for Go, and not just because they love to host GopherCon. Denver is home to many companies who have chosen to build their businesses on Go. 

The Denver Gopher’s room will feature workshops from members of the Denver Gophers user group and local Denver companies like InfluxDB, Bitly and SendGrid.

### CoreOS room

CoreOS is celebrating its second birthday during the CoreOS GopherCon hack day, so join them for a special birthday hack day project, educational talks and workshops from some of your favorite CoreOS team members. In addition, CoreOS will have lightning talks from the Go community on CoreOS tips and tricks. Join in on CoreOS birthday fun, learn how to contribute and leave with more knowledge on CoreOS overall.

### Gobot room

Who doesn’t love robots? What could be better than robots controlled with Go?!? Join last year's speakers, [Ron Evans](https://twitter.com/deadprogram) and [Adrian Zankich](https://twitter.com/adzankich) for all day hardware hacking. Gobot will also provide loaner robots, Intel Edison boards and more for you to hack on. In Go, of course.

### Google room

Google's Francesc Campoy Flores will be giving tutorials on using Go on the Google Cloud Platform. If you're keen to learn how to get started building a simple app with App Engine and Compute Engine, this is the room for you.

### Docker room

Docker will be holding a one day, hands-on class for beginners who want to learn to use and contribute to Docker. Members of the Docker Team will get you up to speed on the basics and coach you from setup to integrating Docker into your working environment. You’ll also learn your way around the Docker Project and leave with the resources to make your first contribution.

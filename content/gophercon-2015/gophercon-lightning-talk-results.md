Registrations for the GopherCon's Hack Day talks closed on the 20th of July, here are the results.

## Forward

After the popularity of the lightning talk sessions last year, and the huge interest the [call for papers](/gophercon2015-speakers-round-3) received, we expected very high demand for [lightning talk slots this year](/gophercon-2015/gophercon-lightning-talks).

Surprisingly, that demand never materialised. However, this is good news, because it means that everyone who registered their interest will have the opportunity to present on stage. Also, due to the lower than expected number of registrations, there was a heavy bias towards the _Hack and Tell_ category, without enough numbers to make up the other two categories.

So, with no need to cater for outrageous demand we've scheduled the speakers _in the order in which they registered_. If you submitted more than one proposal, we've listed all your talk titles, it's up to you to choose which of your proposals you're going to present.

Finally, all the lightning talks will be recorded and available after the conference.

## Speakers

We've scheduled three lightning talk sessions with 10 talks each over the course of Friday July 10th. All talks will be held in the Mile High Ballroom. The first session begins at 11:00 and runs through to lunch at 12:30. The second resumes at 13:30 and runs through to 15:00. After a short break, the third session begins at 15:30 and runs til we run out of speakers or we reach end of day.

## Registrations on the day

We will be accepting registrations on the day, please come to the side of the stage and speak to the organisers. You will present in the third session once all the registered speakers have given their presentations. Registrations on the day will be handled on a first come first served basis.

## The Lightning Talk Rules

Here are a reminder of the rules.

1. Talks are 7 minutes each. After that, the mic is turned off.
2. You'll get one warning at the 5Â½ min mark. 
3. Slides are allowed, but not required, and you can flip them at your own pace.
4. Demos are allowed, but please be mindful of the time and plan ahead for technical issues.
5. One minute for questions while the next speaker is setting up (you can use more if your talk ends early).
6. You can submit as many talks as you like, but to be fair to others, you can only present one talk.
7. All talks must adhere to the GopherCon [Code of Conduct](http://gophercon.com/code-of-conduct/)

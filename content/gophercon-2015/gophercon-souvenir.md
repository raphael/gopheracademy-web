## A unique Gophercon 2015 souvenir

We're excited to announce something that we've been working on behind the scenes for quite a while.

As a gift to GopherCon 2015 attendees who book hotel accommodation through one of our [hotel partners](http://gophercon.com/#hotels), on check in, you will receive one of these as the key to your room:

That's right, something a little different. A hotel room key featuring unique artwork by artist Ren√©e French, creator of the [Go Gopher](http://blog.golang.org/gopher). The key card is yours to keep as a souvenir of GopherCon 2015.

We'll see you at GopherCon!
